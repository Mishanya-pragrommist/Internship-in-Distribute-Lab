This is the task about order book. Here I had to create an order book with the base asset as UAH and quote asset as USD ($)
So how to use this programm? Here is how:
 1) Enter your ID (can be any number excepto for 0 and less), 0 - to buy UAH or 1 - to sell UAH, amount of bought/sold currencies and price for each UAH
 2) Then you will see your order. There will be shown all entered info + total price for order (amount of currencies * price). Also you will see sorted lists of selling and buying orders
    (they are generated randomly). Your order will be in one of the lists
 3) If there is at least one mutch, you will find that order in "Finding matches" section. If you are sure you want to trade, press y/Y, otherwise n/N. After successful trade you can see
    balance changes for you and another trader.
